# Game-Assignment01
Game Challenge Assignment
Created Supratim Ray

This project is made in Unity5 using free license without any intention to use commercially. This is created on for a game assignment given to me. I used few old scripts I had with some minor tweaks and few new scripts. The assets are created with basic asset set available in Unity5 and MS paint.

Currently I would like to call it PoC than a game, as much more needs to be done here. The project can have bugs and need fine tuning and smoothness to be added.

Any question and suggestion regarding this can be mailed to: ray_supratim@yahoo.com.

Any part or whole of the project can not be used for any commercial or non-commercial purpose without written consent from me. However,solely for academic purpose this project can be refered.
